WordPress-URL-Uppercase-to-Lowercase
====================================

A simple WordPress plugin to convert Uppercase url into lowercase url. This plugin is very helpful for SEO.

eg. 
Suppose we have a wordPress website with URL "http://www.xyz.com/abc-zyz/". 
Now some anonymous user typed url like 

"http://www.xyz.com/Abc-zyz/", 
"http://www.xyz.com/ABC-zyz/",
"http://www.xyz.com/Abc-Zyz/" etc, 

All above url's are correct and should redirect to "http://www.xyz.com/abc-zyz/".

Installation:
====================================
1. Upload WordPress-URL-Uppercase-to-Lowercase to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress



Note: Using .htaccess we can achieve it but its too much complicated for beginner or the user who don't know how to edit .htaccess.
